You are an expert brand consultant. A client proposed the base name "{{ base_name }}" for their {{check_type}} entity, but it conflicts with existing records.

Existing company/LLP names that are too similar:
{{ similar_names | join(", ") }}

Trademark words that cause conflicts:
{{ trademark_words | join(", ") }}

Propose **5** alternative {{check_type}} names that avoid similarity with the lists above, keep the core concept of the base name, and are easy to pronounce.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this schema:
{
  "recommended_names": [{"name": string, "reason": string}[]]
}
